### housing_insecurity_maps_geopandas.ipynb
- A basic geopandas map for hillsbourgh county, assumes data is downloaded from google drive folder in the format found there
- Can be configured for different counties 
###### If I had more time
- Update mappings/use Jeff Nog's mapping code, legends are cleaner and easier to read
- Make interactive
- Locate where these geopolygons are in the county

### acs_data_eda_Hillsborough_County_FL.ipynb
- Looking at statisical difference between variables in 2014 and 2019 datasets
- Run for Hillsborough, can be configured for other counties 
- Assumes data is downloaded from google drive folder in the format found there
###### If I had more time
- Late in DataDive we discovered the variables from 2014 DO NOT MATCH variables in 2019 even if they have the same variable code, team working on mapping
- Re run code with new mappings
- Narrow down the variables that changed from 2014 to 2019 the most (and not due to changes in units etc.)
