### DataKind DataDive for the Housing Insecurity Project
<hr>
Work done during the September 2021 DataDive for the Housing Insecurity Project. Following files are included:

1. An IPython notebook `DataDive Housing Insecurity.ipynb`
    1. This file contains code for creating melted long-form datasets from the given data, which allow for easier visualization.
    2. It also has some interactive Plotly based maps that visualize the generated datasets.

2. A pdf of the `.ipynb` file with rendered output provided in case the `.ipynb` does not render.

3. A Tableau Workbook `DataDive Housing Insecurity.twbx`
    1. This makes use of datasets generated by the above IPython notebook and visualizes them in a Tableau Dashboard.
    2. One can use the [Tableau Reader](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader) to open this file.

4. Two `.csv` files - `Hillsborough Aggregate Stats.csv` and `Hillsborough Year Wise.csv` exported by the IPython Notebook above.
