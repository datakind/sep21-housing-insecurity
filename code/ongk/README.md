# Map using Leaflet and OpenStreetMaps

You can view the map by opening the `index.html` file in the `src` folder in your browser.

This map currently uses OpenStreetMaps tile server to fetch the street map tiles. Users can select different metrics to view on the map. Users can also save the page as "Website, complete" and it will save the files locally. These files can then be shared with others. Only an Internet connection is needed to render the street map.
