# Interactive Maps - Task 2
# Task 2: Using the programming language, library, or software of your choice,
# create interactive maps of housing loss for the census tracts of Miami-Dade County,
# FL. Can you display evictions/foreclosures/overall housing loss aside other
# variables, either directly on the maps or using tooltips or similar functionality?

# -----------------------------------------------
# I. Setup/Functions
# -----------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse) # for general data cleaning/simplified style
library(sf) # for spatial data transformation
library(tmap) # great for interactive maps!

# quick helper fxn for fixing the raw number issue (SEE III.)
calculate_pct <- function(num, denom){
  pct <- (num/denom) * 100
}

# -----------------------------------------------
# II. Loading in the Data
# -----------------------------------------------

# since these are not on git made a path variable
# if you are trying to run this with a different file system,
# you SHOULD only need to adjust this line :)
data_dir_path <- "~/Documents/DataKind/DataDiveSept2021/Data/"

# the spatial data for Miami Dade
md_sf <- sf::read_sf(
  paste0(data_dir_path, "miami_dade_fl_2010_tracts_formatted.geojson"))
# summary stats for the county
md_sums <- read_csv(
  paste0(data_dir_path, "miami_dade_fl_processed_2017_to_2019_20210916.csv"))

# -----------------------------------------------
# III. Fixing Summary Stats
# -----------------------------------------------

md_sums <- md_sums %>%
  mutate(
    # First, it seems the pct race variables are raw numbers not percentages
    # So let's reformat...
    # so we have the denominator
    n_residents = `pct-white` + `pct-af-am` + `pct-hispanic` + `pct-am-indian` + 
      `pct-asian` + `pct-nh-pi` + `pct-multiple` + `pct-other`,
    # fixing the pcts for race
    across(
      all_of(
        c("pct-white", "pct-af-am", "pct-hispanic", "pct-am-indian",
          "pct-asian", "pct-nh-pi", "pct-multiple", "pct-other")), 
      # using helper function from setup
      calculate_pct, n_residents
      ),
    # this was also wrong but in a different way
    `pct-non-white` = (100 - `pct-white`),
    `census_tract_GEOID` = as.character(`census_tract_GEOID`), # for join
  ) %>%
  # a quick rename to shift perspectives :)
  rename("pct-poc" = "pct-non-white")

# IV. Appending Summary Statistics to Map
# -----------------------------------------------
# This excerpt has two purposes: 
## A) Sepcifying which data we want to actually showcase in the map
## B) Renaming variables to readable labels to be displayed in the map
#### these new names will be ugly for programmers but prettier for visualizations


# Per the task description we want to highlight:
## evictions/foreclosures/overall housing loss
md_mapping_sums <- md_sums %>%
  transmute(
    `census_tract_GEOID`, # for the join
    # I think this makes things slightly more readable in the map
    `Census Tract` = paste0("Census Tract ", `census_tract_GEOID`),
    #always good to keep in case we combine with other counties
    state, county, county_GEOID,
    `Number of Households` = `total-households`,
    # think this will be the first layer at least
    `Housing Loss Index` = `housing-loss-index`,
    # '' per year (2017-2019)
    `Evictions Per Year` = `avg-evictions`,
    `Mortgage Foreclosures Per Year` = `avg-foreclosure-sales`,
    `Tax Lien Foreclosures Per Year` = `avg-lien-foreclosures`,
    # rates
    `Eviction Rate` = `avg-eviction-rate`,
    `Mortgage Foreclosure Rate` = `avg-foreclosure-rate`,
    `Tax Lien Foreclosure Rate` = `avg-lien-foreclosure-rate`,
    # rounding and adding percent sign so is consistent with other race data 
    # which is formatted in next section
    `Percent People of Color` = round(`pct-poc`) %>% paste0("%"),
    # Income/Rent
    # as char because weird tmap tendency to display as 0 mln
    # probably should add commas for viewers
    `Median Household Income` = `median-household-income` %>% as.character(),
    `Median Gross Rent` = `median-gross-rent`
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    across(is.numeric, round, 2)
  )

# the actual join
md_sf <- left_join(md_sf, md_mapping_sums) %>%
  # dropping those with zero households

# let's make sure we're good..

# V. Appending Racial Breakdowns of Tracts

  filter(pct != 0) %>%
  # grabbing top 2 by each tract

  mutate(
    # this creates a label that will look good in the pop up (I hope)
    `Largest Racial Groups` = ifelse(is.na(race_3),
      paste0(race_1, " (", pct_1, "%), ", race_2, " (", pct_2, "%)"),
      # one has a tie and so a thrid race to display
      paste0(race_1, " (", pct_1, "%), ", race_2, " (", pct_2, "%)", race_3,

# TODOS: 
## 1) Exeperiment with adding a layer for total evictions. Better coverage. 
# Does it change the picture?
## 2) I think it would be interesting to see what adding a layer with colors for
# what the plurality racial group is for tracts could be illuminating in
# determining how certain groups are being discriminated against. Could also
# categorize tracts as something like Majority Black, Majority Hisp, Majority White,
# Mixed (if no majority or perhaps no 2/3 majority).
## 3) Experiment with adding a layer for income brackets
